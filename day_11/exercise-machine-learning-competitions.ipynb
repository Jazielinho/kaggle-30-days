    "Machine learning competitions are a great way to improve your data science skills and measure your progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create and submit predictions for a Kaggle competition. You can then improve your model (e.g. by adding features) to improve and see how you stack up to others taking this micro-course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps in this notebook are:\n",
    "1. Build a Random Forest model with all of your data (**X** and **y**)\n",
    "2. Read in the \"test\" data, which doesn't include values for the target.  Predict home values in the test data with your Random Forest model.\n",
    "3. Submit those predictions to the competition and see your score.\n",
    "4. Optionally, come back to see if you can improve your model by adding features or changing your model. Then you can resubmit to see how that stacks up on the competition leaderboard."
